# QUIZ_APP
Here I created a Quiz app, named "QUIZZO"  using HTML , CSS, &amp; JAVASCRIPT. This app consists of 5 questions where after clicking an answer, you will get to know if that given answer is "correct" or "incorrect". There is a "next" button, using this you can see the next question. And at last, after 5 questions you will get to know about your earned "score"!...
