# QUIZ_APP
Here I created a Quiz app, named "QUIZZO"  using HTML , CSS, &amp; JAVASCRIPT. Here, this app consists of 5 questions where after clicking an answer, you will get to know if that answer is "correct" or "incorrect". There is a "next" button, using this you can see the next question.And at last, after 5 question you will get to know about your "score"!...
